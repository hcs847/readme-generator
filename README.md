  # README File Generator
  # Description
  The README file is the entry point for your repo, a good one can attract a lot of traffic while a mediocre one might drive users away even when a top of the line application was developed. After doing all the hard work of coding, it's hard to go the extra mile and create a markdown file, hence this tool is here to do the work for you.   This Node.js CLI tool will capture all your project-related details and produce a professional README file. Follow the prompts in the terminal, provide the requested answers, and avoid the hassle of formatting a markdown file.
